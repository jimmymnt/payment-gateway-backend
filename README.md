## Oauth 2.0 Authorization Server

- In this project, we have two types of Token
  - [OAuth Tokens](#oauth20-token-management).
    - Oauth token is the Authorization Server tokens, which is used for external user who is authorized with OAuth Application.
  - [User tokens](#user-token-management).
    - User token is the Tokens which is used for the user of this project.

### OAuth2.0 Token Management

### User Token management
- Each Access Token will be valid in 1 hour since created.
  - After the user refreshed their token, the old one will be moved to blacklist.
  - If the user wants to access with the old token, they would be rejected.
- Each Refresh Token will be valid in 30 days since created.
  - Depends on the business, the system will generate new RT and send back to the user after refreshed Token.
- After the user logged out.
  - The accessToken will be added into the "blacklist" to prevent further use.
  - The refreshToken need to be removed as well [TODO.
