## Oauth 2.0 Authorization Server

## Token management
- Each Access Token will be valid in 1 hour since created.
  - After the user refreshed their token, the old one will be moved to blacklist.
  - If the user wants to access with the old token, they would be rejected.
- Each Refresh Token will be valid in 30 days since created.
  - Depends on the business, the system will generate new RT and send back to the user after refreshed Token.
